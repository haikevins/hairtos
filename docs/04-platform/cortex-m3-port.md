## Overview and Core Concepts

The Cortex-M3 port uses CPU exception stacking: hardware automatically saves R0–R3, R12, LR, PC, and xPSR on the PSP; PendSV only needs to save/restore R4–R11. SVC transitions from `main()`/MSP to the first task/PSP, while PendSV handles subsequent context switches.


<a id="implementation"></a>
## Implementation in the Repository

The current implementation includes:

- The TCB places `stack_pointer` at offset 0 and uses `_Static_assert` so assembly can load/store the saved PSP without knowing the rest of the C layout.
- The initial stack frame is constructed to match a real exception-return frame; the top of stack is aligned down to 8 bytes.
- After SVC, Thread mode runs privileged using PSP (`CONTROL.SPSEL=1`); Handler mode continues using MSP.
- PendSV is configured at the lowest priority so next-task selection cannot preempt more important exceptions.
- The current port does not save FPU context because `HR_CFG_USE_FPU=0` and the Cortex-M3 reference target has no FPU.
- restore software frame;
- set PSP;
- select PSP in Thread mode;
- exception return.
- BASEPRI critical ceiling;
- Cortex-M4F variant with optional FP context;
- interrupt priority validation;

## Execution Model and Runtime Flow

**Exception entry and software save**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Current task
    participant CPU as Cortex-M3
    participant P as PendSV
    T->>CPU: PendSV pending
    CPU->>P: stack hardware frame
    P->>P: save R4-R11
```

**Task selection and restore**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as PendSV
    participant K as Kernel selector
    participant N as Next task
    P->>K: select next TCB
    K-->>P: update current TCB
    P->>P: restore R4-R11
    P-->>N: exception return
```

<a id="invariants"></a>
## Ownership, Concurrency, and Invariants

The following baseline invariants apply to this topic:

- A public opaque object is valid only after a successful create/init operation and when its magic/internal state matches the contract.
- An intrusive node may be linked into exactly one list at a time; remove/timeout/wake paths must leave the node in a consistent unlinked state.
- A thread API may block only while the kernel is RUNNING and the caller is not in ISR context; ISR APIs must be non-blocking and use `higher_priority_task_woken` when a switch should be deferred to PendSV.
- Critical sections currently use PRIMASK on Cortex-M3, globally masking interrupts for a short bounded interval; therefore critical-section code must remain bounded and must not invoke operations that can block.
- Ready/wait policy uses **effective priority** while mutex priority inheritance is active; base priority remains the task's configured priority.
- Static-first does not mean “no lifetime”: caller-owned TCB, stack, queue storage, and event-pool storage must outlive every object that still references them.

<a id="failure"></a>
## Failure Modes and Limitations

- `hairtos 1.0.0-rc1` is single-core and provides no SMP, FPU context management, MPU isolation, or general-purpose dynamic kernel heap.
- The current interrupt-masking model uses PRIMASK; the repository does not yet define a BASEPRI ceiling contract for applications with complex ISR-priority schemes.
- Tickless idle is not implemented; the current time model uses a 1 kHz tick on the reference target.
- `haievent` v1 provides a flat state machine and one task per AO; HSMs, deferred events, and a shared executor are Version 2 roadmap items.
- A successful build/link does not by itself prove real-time timing or race-free behavior on hardware; target tests and measurements remain necessary.

<a id="validation"></a>
## Validation and Verification

- The repository's host suite is built with GCC, AddressSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and `ctest`.
- Host validation baseline: `make TARGET=bluepill_f103c8 host-tests` PASS.
- Host examples `02-kernel-data-structures-host`, `14-memory-allocator-lab`, and `16-diagnostics-stress-stabilization` pass; the scheduler stress test reports 500,000 iterations.
- Do not infer target-runtime PASS from host tests. Cortex-M3 assembly, timing, exception priorities, UART/LED behavior, and hardware clocks still require cross-build and board validation.
