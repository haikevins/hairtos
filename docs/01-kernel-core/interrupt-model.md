## Overview and Core Concepts

The hairtos scheduler is fixed-priority and preemptive. Lower numeric priority values represent higher scheduling priority. The ready set contains one intrusive FIFO list per priority and a bitmap identifying non-empty levels. Round-robin rotates only the FIFO at the highest ready priority when time slicing is enabled.

## Implementation in the Repository

The current implementation includes:

- A READY task appears exactly once in the ready set; its node must not simultaneously belong to another list.
- Selection is independent of registration order across different priorities: the lowest-numbered priority whose bitmap bit is set always wins.
- Tasks at the same priority are ordered FIFO; `yield`/time slicing rotates the highest-priority ready queue rather than changing priority.
- Preemption occurs only when a READY task has a numerically lower effective priority than the current task; equal-priority peers require yield or time slicing to rotate execution.
- Any change to the effective priority of a READY task must requeue its ready node so the bitmap/list reflects the new priority.
- queue send/receive from ISR;
- semaphore give from ISR;
- Active Object post from ISR.
- does not block;
- does not use finite waits;
- returns/writes `higher_priority_task_woken`;
- the caller invokes `hr_yield_from_isr()`.

Key implementation details:

- max syscall interrupt priority;
- an explicit rule defining which ISRs may call kernel APIs;
- a BASEPRI implementation on M3/M4;
- validation priority configuration;
- latency benchmark for critical sections.

## Ownership, Concurrency, and Invariants

The following baseline invariants apply to this topic:

- A public opaque object is valid only after a successful create/init operation and when its magic/internal state matches the contract.
- An intrusive node may be linked into exactly one list at a time; remove/timeout/wake paths must leave the node in a consistent unlinked state.
- A thread API may block only while the kernel is RUNNING and the caller is not in ISR context; ISR APIs must be non-blocking and use `higher_priority_task_woken` when a switch should be deferred to PendSV.
- Critical sections currently use PRIMASK on Cortex-M3, globally masking interrupts for a short bounded interval; therefore critical-section code must remain bounded and must not invoke operations that can block.
- Ready/wait policy uses **effective priority** while mutex priority inheritance is active; base priority remains the task's configured priority.
- Static-first does not mean “no lifetime”: caller-owned TCB, stack, queue storage, and event-pool storage must outlive every object that still references them.

<a id="failure"></a>
## Failure Modes and Limitations

- `hairtos 1.0.0-rc1` is single-core and provides no SMP, FPU context management, MPU isolation, or general-purpose dynamic kernel heap.
- The current interrupt-masking model uses PRIMASK; the repository does not yet define a BASEPRI ceiling contract for applications with complex ISR-priority schemes.
- Tickless idle is not implemented; the current time model uses a 1 kHz tick on the reference target.
- `haievent` v1 provides a flat state machine and one task per AO; HSMs, deferred events, and a shared executor are Version 2 roadmap items.
- A successful build/link does not by itself prove real-time timing or race-free behavior on hardware; target tests and measurements remain necessary.

<a id="validation"></a>
## Validation and Verification

- The repository's host suite is built with GCC, AddressSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and `ctest`.
- Host validation baseline: `make TARGET=bluepill_f103c8 host-tests` PASS.
- Host examples `02-kernel-data-structures-host`, `14-memory-allocator-lab`, and `16-diagnostics-stress-stabilization` pass; the scheduler stress test reports 500,000 iterations.
- Do not infer target-runtime PASS from host tests. Cortex-M3 assembly, timing, exception priorities, UART/LED behavior, and hardware clocks still require cross-build and board validation.
